Welcome to Beyond Doctrine!

All I really do here is rant about whatever I find interesting at the time.
I was born and raised in an incredibly religious household, so, spoiler: it's about religion.
Christianity, if you're wondering.

I do my best to keep my writing professional and unbiased, but I would never consider it academic.
My advice is: do your own research.

But check out the site, too!  Life is all about looking at things from different perspectives.
A humble person is an intelligent person.

"The first to plead his case seems right, until [a GitHub repo] comes along and cross-examines him."
- Proverbs 18:17 (unknown translation)
